This is a repo for the final project for the coursera class Getting and Cleaning data.

This R code aims to do 5 things.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The original data can be found here http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


Steps include
-reading in the data set
-viewing files from the data
-name the columns in test and train then combine x files and yfiles
-combine comes from gdata package
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
-index columns mean and standard dev columns
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
-merge x and y files into a single dataset- both already cotain both training and test data
-creates a second, independent tidy 
-data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
